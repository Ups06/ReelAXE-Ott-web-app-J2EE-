 Its a web app made with J2EE technology , tomcat 10 and this contains users with Session features and Admin upload and delete pages

make a data base in Mysql table 1
create table user( uid varchar(50) primarykey, uname varchar(45), uemail varchar(45), uage varchar(45), uphn varchar(45), ugender varchar(45), subStrt DATETIME, subEnd DATETIME, SubAmt Double, upass varchar(45) );

Table 2 
create table video( vid varchar(255) primarykey, title varchar(255), category varchar(30), thumb varchar(255), decription text, path varchar(255) );

then connect the database wherever required in MISC package and in some JSP pages with your User name and Password, you can also use an remote Data base with a particular IP address and port number.

Setup the project in Eclipse or What ever you want ! to upload a Video Admin have to log in AdminLogin.JSP page with id admin@gmail.com and password 1111 (can be reset from validAdmin.jsp)

Videos has to be saved in VIDstore and thumbnails in IMG folder in webapp upload them from there
